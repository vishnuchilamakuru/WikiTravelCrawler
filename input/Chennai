<p>Long the site of earlier coastal settlements, Madras was founded in 1639 when the British East India Company (represented by Francis Day and Andrew Cogan and aided by a local translator Beri Thimappa) was granted land to build a trading settlement by the local ruler (Nayak) of the suburb of Vandavasi, Damerla Venkatapathy Nayak. The document of the land grant is dated 22 August 1639, and hence Madras celebrates its birthday on 22 August each year as Madras day.  Madras was one of the first outposts of British East India Company. Colonel William Lambton, superintendent of the great Trigonometrical Survey of India, started his journey of triangulating India from St. Thomas Mount. The British built <b>Fort St. George</b> (today the legislative and administrative seat of the state). Fort St George was completed on St George's day in 1640 (23 April) and hence was named after the patron saint. George Town then developed becoming the modern city of Madras, absorbing several nearby boroughs. Thomas, one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ, is associated with Chennai. He is said to have come to India as an evangelist and died in what is now Chennai. Two suburbs, Santhome and St. Thomas Mount, are named in his memory.
</p><p>In 1996, the Tamilnadu government renamed Madras to Chennai providing the reason that 'Chennai' was the city's traditional name while Madras was one derived during colonial rule. 
</p><p>Madras is derived from <i>Madraspatnam</i>, a name given to the area when the British negotiated settling there. The origin of the name is uncertain. Tradition suggests that a fishing village near to the location of the British settlement was called Madraspatnam. Others think early Portuguese may have called the area <i>Madre de Sois</i> after an early settler, or <i>Madre de Deus</i> after an early church (of St. Mary). 
</p><p>Chennai is derived from <i>Chennapatnam</i>, a name with almost equally uncertain origins. Tradition has it that Chennapatnam was the name of a fishing village near to the location of Madraspatnam. However it is not clear if the village was there beforehand or grew up around the <i>British</i> Madraspatnam settlement. There are some suggestions that the name was given to the developing <i>Indian</i> settlement honor a local Indian administrator. 
</p><p>As the settlements grew, the exact location of both <i>Chennapatnam</i> and <i>Madraspatnam</i> became confused as the two settlements merged into a single town. 
</p><p>Under the British, the then city of Madras grew to be a major city, It was the capital of the <b>Madras presidency</b>, a province that covered the parts of <a href="/en/Southern_India" title="Southern India">Southern India</a> that were not governed by any of the other princely states. After independence, it became the capital of <b>Madras state</b>, and when the states were reorganized on a linguistic basis, it became the capital of Tamilnadu.
</p><p>Chennai boasts of many well known people including  Elihu Yale, whose  liberal gift funded the construction of Yale University in 1718; Indira Nooyi CEO of Pepsi International; A.R. Rahman, the musical genius  of "Slumdog Millionaire", Manirathnam the ace film Director, Vijay Armirthraj, Ramesh Krishnan and his father Ramanathan krishnan who were holding the Indian flag high in Tennis and chess wizard Vishwanathan Anand among many others.

<p>Chennai is gateway to the South, and its culture is distinctly different from that of any other city in India. Tamil tradition and culture is essentially the celebration of the beauty, which is exemplified through dance, clothing, and sculptures. Chennai is both an orthodox and a modern cosmopolitan city; the culture of the city reflects its diverse population. The traditional arts, music, dance and all other art forms of Tamilnadu grow and flourish here.  The food is a unique blend of traditional, to fast foods and filter kaapi. It’s a land of temples and priests. The architecture ranges from ancient temples to modern high-rises.  Music is classical and western, to the growing nightlife in the city. You can find a school for traditional Bharatanatyam or Salsa dance and for music a veena / violin or for Guitar/drums school in almost every neighborhood of the city. Chennai checks reflects its traditionalism every December when the music season is in full swing. Clothes are generally conservative but young people are contemporary.

<ul><li><b>Traditional Tamil Clothing</b> - Tamil women traditionally wear the <b>Saree or Sari</b> while the men wear <b>Dhoti</b>, which could be either a white pancha or a colourful <b>lungi</b> with typical South Indian patterns. The sari, being an un-stitched wrap, enhances the shape of the wearer while only partially covering the midriff. In Indian philosophy, the navel of the Supreme Being is considered as the source of life and creativity. Therefore by tradition, the stomach and the navel is to be left unconcealed, though the philosophy behind the costume has largely been forgotten. This makes the realization of sharira-mandala (the body), where in Angikam bhuvanam yasya (the body is your world) unites with the shaarira-mandala (the whole universe), as expressed in the Natyashastra. These principles of the sari, also hold for other forms of wraps, like the lungi or worn by men. The lungi can be wrapped over clockwise or anticlockwise and can be tied at the back or fixed just along the waist line. It's sometimes lifted till knee and tied at the waist leisurely or just held in hand to speed up walking. In tradition Brahmin homes men wear kachche panchey where it is tied at back by taking it between legs. Similar pattern is seen in women.

<ul><li><b>Tamilnadu Cuisine</b> - Rice is the staple diet in Chennai, Dosa, Idli and Uttapam are popular in Chennai. The state of Tamilnadu has a distinct place in culinary map of the country. Chennai has a wide range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian delicacies to offer. The food here gets its flavor from a host of spices and condiments used in Tamil Nadu. Coconut, tamarind and asafetida are a must for almost all vegetarian recipes. Garam masala is avoided in Tamil cuisine. Refined <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Gingelly_oil&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Gingelly oil (page does not exist)">gingelly oil</a> is normally used as the medium of cooking. Chutneys and mixed spice are served in the lunch and enhance the taste of the meal. The <b>Tamilnadu lunch or meals</b> in Chennai consists of cooked rice served with different kinds of vegetable dishes, Sambar, chutneys, Rasam (a hot broth made with tamarind juice and pepper) and curd (yogurt). The non-vegetarian lunch includes curries or dishes cooked with mutton, chicken or fish. Tamil meals are incomplete without crisp Papads or Appalam. In Chennai, Chettinad cuisine of Tamil Nadu is particularly famous. This cuisine is hot and spicy and provides delectable variety in mutton, chicken and fish dishes. <b>Chettinad Pepper Chicken</b> is one of the most famous dishes in Tamil Nadu. The Chennai style of Mughalai food can be tasted in the Biryani and Paya. Paya is a type of spiced trotter’s broth and is eaten with either Parathas or Appam. Breakfast or tiffin in Chennai includes <b>idly</b> (steamed rice cakes), <b>dosai</b> (a pancake made from a batter of rice) and lentils crisp fried on a pan, <b>vadai</b> (deep fried doughnuts made from a batter of lentils), <b>pongal</b> (a mash of rice and lentils boiled together and seasoned with ghee, cashew nuts, pepper and cummin seed), <b>uppuma</b> (cooked semolina seasoned in oil with mustard, pepper, cumin seed and dry lentils). Most of the breakfast dishes in Chennai are eaten with coconut <b>chutney, sambar</b> (seasoned lentil broth) and <b>mulagai podi</b> (a powdered mix of several dried lentils eaten with oil). Tamil Nadu, especially Chennai, is famous for its <b>filter coffee</b>. Most Tamils have a subtle disliking for instant coffee; therefore filter coffee is more popular. The preparation of filter coffee is almost like a daily chore, the coffee beans have to be first roasted and then ground. The coffee powder is then put into a filter set and hot boiled water is added to prepare the boiling and allowed to set for about 15 minutes. The decoction is then added to milk with sugar to taste. The drink thus prepared is then poured from one container to another in rapid succession to make the perfect frothy cup of filter coffee. An exotic drink that refreshes you and the taste that lingers, served best in "Dabarah" set which includes a steel tumbler and saucer with a rim.

<ul><li><b>Music</b> - There are many composers in Carnatic music. Purandara Dasa (1480-1564) is known as the father (Pitamaha) of Carnatic music due to his pioneering contributions to Carnatic music. Purandara Dasa is renowned for formulating the basic lessons of Carnatic music. The contemporaries Tyagaraja (1759-1847), <b>Muthuswami Dikshitar,</b> (1776-1827) and <b>Syama Sastri</b> (1762-1827), are regarded as the Trinity of Carnatic music due to the quality of Syama Sastri's compositions, the varieties of compositions of Muthuswami Dikshitar and Tyagaraja's prolific output in composing kritis. The compositions of these composers are rendered frequently by artists of today during the music festival season. <b>Chennai Music Festival or December Season</b> is a celebration of classical music and dance of South India held during mid December to mid January in the capital city of Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The festival is held at a number of venues around the city by various '<b>sabhas'</b> or organizations. Besides the auditoriums, well-known temple premises and heritage bungalows are being used as venues. The month long dance and music extravaganza will have performances of eminent artistes from various parts of India. <b>The 'Margazhi festival of Dance and Music'</b> started early back in 1927, to commemorate the anniversary of Madras Music Academy every December, was later adopted by various organizations which held art festivals in different parts of the city. The Tamil month of '<b>Margazhi' (December)</b> is a sacred month of the Hindus. South Indian classical music (Carnatic Music) which has its roots in devotion to the gods, has been a traditional form of worship from time immemorial. The city comes alive with the festival which has now developed into a cultural extravaganza with more than 2,000 artists participating in over 300 concerts. The festival also known as 'December Season' attracts expatriate Indians and scholars from around the world as well. Performances include Vocal and Instrumental music, Dance - solo and group, both by junior and senior artistes. Even upcoming artists get a chance to perform along with well-established artists. The music include classical vocal renditions in various South Indian languages like Tamil, Telugu and Kannada and instruments like Flute, Veena (a large string instrument), Goottuvadyam (similar to Veena but without frets), 'Nagaswaram' (pipe), 'Thavil' (percussion instrument), 'Mridangam' (drum), and even 'Ghatam' (a mud pot). The season goes on till mid January when the scene shifts to Tiruvaiyaru, near Tanjore, where 'Thyagaraja Aradhana' a week long music festival is held to celebrate the birth of one of the greatest Carnatic composers and one among the trinity of music - Thyagaraja.  Information about the tickets and the venues can be had from the tourist office, Chennai. The weather is cool and pleasant at this time of the year. November- December is the best season to visit the city. Now the music in the motion picture industry has emerged as an important entertainment platform in Chennai, over the years portraying the cultural changes, trends, aspirations and developments experienced by its people.

<ul><li><b>Dance</b> - Chennai is home to the distinct dance form- the Bharat Natyam. <b>Bharatanatyam</b> is the celebration of the eternal universe through the celebration of the beauty of the body. This is done through its tenets of having a perfectly erect posture, a straight and pout curving stomach, a well rounded and proportionate body mass- to the body structure, very long hair and curvaceous hips. These tenets bring to life the philosophy of Natyashastra, ‘Angikam bhuvanam yasya’ (The body is your world). This is elaborated in the araimandi posture, wherein the performer assumes a half sitting position with the knees turned sideways, with a very erect posture. In this fundamental posture of the Bharatanatyam dance, the distance between the head and the navel becomes equal to that between the earth and the navel. In a similar way the distance between the outstretched right arm to the outstretched left arm becomes equal to the distance between the head and the feet, thus representing the "Natyapurusha", the embodiment of life and creation.

<p><b><a href="/en/Tamil_phrasebook" title="Tamil phrasebook">Tamil</a></b> is the official language in Chennai, and also the first language of most locals. Almost all people speak Tamil, a classical language, picking up some knowledge of the local language is useful to get by in Chennai as in every city in the world. However, knowledge of English is sufficient for the average visitor to the city. English education is widespread in Chennai, thanks to an excellent network of schools throughout the city. All educated people in Chennai can speak fluent English while almost everybody will understand simple English and can speak a few words. All important signboards are in English. All transactions with commercial establishments are typically in English.
</p><p>Unlike other major northern cities in India, <a href="/en/Hindi_phrasebook" title="Hindi phrasebook">Hindi</a> is <i>not</i> widely understood,while there has been a significant increase in Hindi speakers ,many locals may find it odd when you try to speak to them in Hindi.You are better of speaking very slow English than Hindi in most southern states.
</p><p>Those native to Chennai and its suburbs speak the language of Tamil with a characteristic accent. Due to the proximity of the city to the State of Andhra Pradesh (where the official language is Telugu) and a presence of sizable quasi-telugu speaking population in the city, there is heavy borrowing of telugu words into the vocabulary of 'Chennai Tamil'. Another characteristic of Chennai Tamil is that the words are spoken fast, possible in line with the fast-paced life in Chennai when compared with the rest of the state. However, the Chennai accent does not go well with many Tamil. At best, Chennai tamil could be termed 'crude'. Nevertheless, all educated people are taught standard Tamil in school, and standard Tamil is still used in more formal settings as well as in the news.

<p>The cheapest and most authentic way to the city is by taking the train into town which only costs a few rupees. This is best if you don't have large amounts of baggage.  Otherwise, use the pre-paid taxi booth.  Aviation Express is massively overpriced.
</p><p>Using the <b>pre-paid taxi</b> to get to the city, each terminal has several booths for several taxi companies when you exit the airport, outside before you meet the crowd.  <b>Fast Track</b> has the best rep, figure on around <a href="/en/Indian_rupee" title="Indian rupee"><img alt="Indian rupee" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/56/Indian_Rupee_symbol.png/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.png" width="7" height="10" style="vertical-align: baseline" /></a>550 to the city centre for a Toyota Innova or equivalent.  The fares are different for the domestic and international terminals though the terminals are next to each other. You can either choose the standard Taxis (Black with Yellow tops) which are usually the ancient Ambassador cars or the private call-taxi (which can come in any model and in any color). It's better to keep small change in hand while paying at the counters. Note the taxi number written on your charge slip (one copy is for the passenger and the other is for the driver to collect the fare from the counter). Make your way to the taxi stand and get the taxi number allotted at the designated desk. The helpful drivers offer to take your luggage and guide you to the taxi that drives up quickly near the allotment desk.   
</p><p>A new cab provider named "Fasttrack" has started off their service and a pre-paid booth of them is available at both domestic and international terminals. Comparing with the rest of the taxis their fare and service is pretty much good. Depends on your need you can get from Maruti van to Toyota Innova
</p><p>Prepaid and yellow top taxis are not air-conditioned, are of vintages right from 70s and 80s, rickety, prone to stop midway, drivers exhibit rough behaviour, sometimes could be dangerous, demand exorbitant fares, pre-paid may mean nothing and they may demand more when you get down.   Keep away from these types.
</p><p>You can also get to the city center by <b>train</b>. Just get outside of the airport, and keep walking through the carpark to the main road, cross it to the far side. There is also an underpass that you can use to get across this rd (National highway 45) if you feel uncomfortable walking across it. Once across, turn left and walk for about 150m. You will then reach the Tirisulam railway station building on your right, from where you can take a train that transports you to the city.
</p><p>It is advisable to take a first class ticket in the train if you happen to reach the airport during peak hours. The general compartments are often crowded as they transport regular commuters to work. In peak hours even the first class compartments may also be crowded.

<p>Auto-rickshaw drivers in Chennai do not use meters; some try to overcharge and often drive rashly, but that's part of the fun of being in Chennai. They are happy to exploit foreigners and locals alike. The advantage of being a local is that you know when you're being fleeced, and so you'll know when to walk away and find another auto. The upside is that autos are ubiquitous and possibly the easiest form of transportation to locate. Use Auto-rickshaws only for short distances because they are uncomfortable. Before talking to an auto driver you might like to try and ask any local person what the actual fare should be, because the drivers will often ask for up to 3 times more. Even so, by Western standards they are dirt cheap. You'll have no problem once the fare has been agreed and for short trips the Auto is a must.  The local government of Chennai has  failed to regulate the price mechanism of the auto-rickshaws, possibly because they tried to set the price unreasonably low. 
</p><p>If you want to travel by the auto, stick to these rules:
</p>
<ul><li> Dont take the first auto or take the first price ,take a least quote and go to the second or third.
</li><li> Never leave anything behind when you leave.
</li><li> Forget the meter; no one will go by it, and if they do, it's probably rigged to show a higher fare.
</li><li> Negotiate a rate with the driver beforehand; if he doesn't agree, just go to the next auto on the road; there will always be others unless it's very late or very early or you are in a remote area: then be prepared to pay up. Stick to the agreed price, though on very rare occasions the driver may attempt to ask for more. 
</li><li> Consult local friends beforehand to find out reasonable market prices for the distance you intend to go.
</li><li> Try to hail individual auto rickshaws in traffic which are heading in the general direction of your destination.
</li></ul>
<p>As a general rule, expect to pay about <a href="/en/Indian_rupee" title="Indian rupee"><img alt="Indian rupee" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/56/Indian_Rupee_symbol.png/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.png" width="7" height="10" style="vertical-align: baseline" /></a>10 to <a href="/en/Indian_rupee" title="Indian rupee"><img alt="Indian rupee" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/56/Indian_Rupee_symbol.png/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.png" width="7" height="10" style="vertical-align: baseline" /></a>15 for every kilometer (0.6 mi) you travel. 
</p><p>Be careful about the following when you plan to undertake an auto-rickshaw trip:
</p>
<ul><li> You don't have to pay for any empty return trips that the auto-rickshaw driver has to make once you have agreed upon a fare.
</li><li> You tell them to go to a landmark near where you want to go, and upon reaching the landmark, ask them to go a little further along a particular road to your destination. They might cite the extra distance traveled and ask for more money. So it is better to negotiate the fare upfront.
</li><li> You don't have to pay for petrol during the ride.
</li><li> If you pay them for petrol, make sure you pay them the remaining fare amount after subtracting petrol charges.
</li><li> Sometimes airport and Railway station have something called prepaid auto section they would have a tariff chart also, the actual cost should be around ~20 rupees of the amount.
</li></ul>
<p>The call taxis are better regulated and can be ordered air-conditioned, although unlike auto-rickshaws, advance reservations are needed and they cannot usually be flagged on the street.
</p><p><b>Share autos</b> have emerged in the recent years as an alternative mode of transport in Chennai. They are over-sized three wheelers running on diesel and charge slightly more than the bus. There are four wheelers known as <b>meter taxis</b>, which don't have a meter and are not taxis. Recently, yet another four wheeler, <b>Magic</b>(manufactured by Tata), has started running in and around the city, which operate similar to share autos and meter taxis.  They are all over crowded and the drivers indulge in rash driving, owing to the competition. The only advantage is that it is cost effective.
</p><p>On a side note - if you are fascinated by the idea of going around in an auto, think about all those foreigners, who are riding an auto from Chennai to Mumbai. 
A Chennai based event management company, Chennai Event Management Services, has been having these auto-rickshaw rallies from Chennai to Mumbai, or Kanyakumari, etc.,
and has developed a great fan following for the same. More info: <a href="http://www.autorickshawchallenge.com" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>

<ul><li> <b>Marina Beach</b>, is 12&#160;km long and offers excellent opportunities for walks and has a very wide sandy foreshore.  Its width is up to 300&#160;m (985&#160;ft). The Marina of Madras is the second longest beach in the world. it is an elegant promenade with flower beds along its lanes. Along the shore, there are many buildings built during the British colonial rule. The South Beach Road runs past the Madras University, the Senate House, the Chepauk Palace (Nawabs of Carnatica once held their court here). It is the most popular gathering place for locals, especially in the evenings and on weekends. It can also get very crowded at those times. The beach is relatively less crowded in the early mornings and more pleasant. Walk along the Marina in the evening to cool off and eat <b>crispy sundal</b> and <b>murukku.</b> Watching sunset and sunrise from the beach is an experience by itself. It's not a swimming beach, though you will see people fully clothed taking partial dips. Other lesser known places in the Marina: <b>Anna Square:</b> Dr. C.N. Annadurai, former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu was a very respectable personality among the people of Tamil Nadu. The mortal remains of Dr. C.N. Annadurai were buried at Anna Square, which is situated at the northern end of the Marina Beach. People from different parts of the state come here to pay their tribute to the great leader. It is located in the center of a park and the entrance is attractive. The beautiful arch is in the shape of twin converging elephant tusks. The tomb of Dr. C.N. Annadurai is flanked by imposing memorial pillar and eternal flame. People of Tamil Nadu affectionately called him 'Anna' meaning the elder brother. Though listed here Anna Square is not a must see place. There is nothing much to see, unless you have lots of time to spare.

<ul><li> <b>Edward Elliot's beach</b>, is spread along the coast down south from Marina. It is also the night beach for Chennai youth. This beach is comparatively quieter and it is located near Besant Nagar. At the end of this beach are the Velankanni church and the Ashtalakshmi temple. Good roads, pavements, walking track illuminated sands, makes a visit to this beach a real pleasure. 
</li><li><b>Breezy Beach</b> is located in the quiet neighborhood of Valmiki Nagar (Thiruvanmiyur) in Chennai. It is smaller and less popular than the Elliot's beach. This beach is not as commercialized as the Elliot's beach, and is hence more quiet and peaceful. Evenings are very pleasant and with gentle breezy here, Lots of tourists are attracted towards this beach. Since the residential area around this beach is occupied predominantly by young professionals working in the IT/ITES industries (that thrive in the area), this beach has turned into a hot-spot for them. It is less polluted and environment friendly. Those who look for a calm, cool and breezy place to relax, this beach is the best place in Chennai.

Basilica of the National Shrine of St.Thomas is in Chennai, India. The present National Shrine of St.Thomas is built over the tomb of Saint Thomas the Apostle, who came to India in the year 52 AD. After preaching on the West coast, he came to Chennai (formerly Madras), and suffered martyrdom on a hill at the outskirts of the city, today known as "St. Thomas Mount." <i><b>His body was buried on the spot over which the present Basilica stands.</b></i> The shrine was restored in 2004. A valuable work of art kept in the Basilica is an ancient painting of Our Blessed Mother, in front of which the other great apostle of India, St. Francis Xavier, used to pray. There are two new structures today: <b>The Tomb Chapel</b> below the Basilica and <b>Museum cum theatre</b>. The new underground chapel with a separate access outside the church structure, allows pilgrims to pray at the tomb and tourists to visit it, without disturbing the sacred functions in the church. The museum exhibits artifacts connected with St. Thomas and the Basilica, and the theatre is used for screening a short video on the life of the Apostle. 5:AM-9PM daily. +91 44 24985455, +91 44 24980758.

<ul><li> <b>St. Mary's Church,</b> situated in the fort, is one of <i><b>the oldest surviving churches built by the British</b></i> in India. This is the first English church in India and the oldest Anglican church in the East.Designed by William Dixon, the then Master Gunner of the Fort, it was constructed under the supervision of the Governor Streynsham Master. Given the precarious nature of the English presence in India at the time (not to mention later attacks by the French and the locals), the church has a defensive stance- thick walls, castellated parapets and a well within the grounds - to withstand any bombardment or siege). The church was consecrated on 28 October 1680. The tower was completed in 1701; the steeple added in 1710 and the tower was connected to the main body of the church in 1759. Robert Clive - more famous as Clive of India- married Margaret Maskelyne here in 1753. The first but equally famous wedding was that of Governor Elihu Yale (who was to become the benefactor of Yale College) to Catherine Himmers in November 1680. The interior of the church contains many fascinating plaques and monuments to early British India evoking past glories and lives full of achievement. It also contains the old colours of the Madras Fusiliers, the first European regiment of the East India Company. The glass windows, wall frescos, teak plaques still shine with their all time glory. 10AM-5PM daily except closed on F.

<ul><li> <b>St. Thomas Mount</b> St Thomas Mount, St Thomas Mount, Chennai South. St.Thomas, referred to as Didymus, in the Gospel of St.John is one of the twelve disciples of Jesus Christ. He is one of the prime witnesses to the resurrection of Jesus. St. Thomas Mount is associated with St. Thomas, the apostle of Christ, who is believed to have been martyred here. The mount is commonly called in Tamil "Parangi Malai" or "Bhringi Malai'.History says 2000 years ago, a saint 'Parangi' lived here ('parangi' in Tamil language is used to refer to a white person). According to local myth, St. Thomas was one of the first Christians to reach India and to preach Christianity. He is believed to have reached South India in AD 52, and spent the last years of his life in a cave on this hill. Tradition states that Thomas was assassinated by an arrow in AD 72, by persons hostile to him. Thus, the hillock acquired the name St. Thomas Mount. Over time Anglo-Indians predominated in this area. A small relic-filled Church built in 1523 by the Portuguese stands at the summit of the 300 feet high St. Thomas Mount. The place was visited by Pope John Paul II during his visit to India on 5 February 1986. At the northern foot of the mount, is a gateway of four impressive arches surmounted by a cross bearing the inscribed date 1547. A flight of 160 steps leads up to the summit of the mount. There are fourteen stations of the cross erected on the way to the summit.

It may be mentioned in this regard that, as far as is known, no other mosque in the world has a chronogram composed by a non-Muslim. The Mosque has two minarets at the front. Medieval architecture is clearly visible in the construction of this great mosque. <i>The Eid Prayer timing remains the same, 10AM, since 1749 A.D.</i> This historic mosque is under the management of H.H. Adjoining the Wallajah Mosque is the tomb of the great Islamic saint Maulana Abdul Ali Bahrul Uloom, a divine scholar of the days of the Nawab Wallajah. In this enclosure also are the tombs of the late Nawabs of the Carnatic, the Princess of Arcot and other eminent Muslim scholars and theologians.

It was (formerly known as White Town) was established as the East India Company's fortified foothold in Madras and it was from this small trading post (or 'factory' as it was then known) that British influence spread throughout India. The establishment of Fort St. George marked the birth of the new city that is Madras, in the year 1640. The fort was named after St George who is believed to have preached in the region. The British East India Company, after buying the land from the <b>Nayak of Vandavasi in 1639</b>, led the establishment of what was called the <b>Madrasemen</b>, the permanent settlement of the company. One year later they built the fort as a commanding post in the region. With the increased trade activities of East India Company the region soon developed into a popular trade and commerce centre. The British enjoyed the supremacy in the region till 1746, when the French attacked the fort and captured it. After three years, in 1749 the British regained the ruling power by signing a treaty with the French. In the meantime they fortified the base in order to sustain the invasion of Hyder Ali and the French. <i>The fort is believed to be the first establishment of the British in India.</i> It is a military architecture marvel, which was started as a trading post and later evolved to be the origin of modern Indian Army.

<ul><li>During summers it becomes too hot and humid to venture out during the day. So go out for a stroll during the night (7-9 PM) on the <b>Marina beach</b> and <b>Elliots Beach (Besant Nagar).</b> It's a nice idea to pack dinner and have a picnic on the beach as most locals do. If you happen to drive a car you can also consider taking along a few foldable chairs. Beyond 10 PM, no one is permitted to be on the beach. There are policemen on the beach to ensure people follow this rule, and on some occasions they tend to shoo people out by 9 PM. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Stroll along the over crowded <b>Pondy Bazaar</b> and <b>Ranganathan Street</b> and try your skills in bargaining for knick-knacks. Be warned that it is an intensely crowded place, where you have to elbow your way through. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Take a bus or an auto to <b>Mylapore Tank</b> and take a walk around <b>Mylapore</b> especially in and around the <b>Kapaleeshwarar Temple</b>. The crowds, sounds, fragrances of temple incense and flowers and the tiny shops are to be definitely experienced though keep away on Fridays. It gets too hectic even for experienced Mylaporeans.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Chennai is also home to one of the best preserved Art Deco architectural areas in India, <b>Parry's Corner</b>. Its also Chennai's oldest Central Business District though it has long since given way to Nungambakkam and T Nagar. If you're particularly interested in architecture or photography, this is a must visit place. Don't forget the nooks and crannies.

There is a reasonably good food court on the 2nd level of Phase I and Phase III.

</li><li><b>FabIndia</b>. <a href="http://fabindia.com/storesfrontdetails.asp?Indian_Stores=7:Chennai" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>. The Ilford House location at 3 Woods Road is probably the best in terms of choices and selections. This is the place to go for all your natural-dyed, hand loomed and hand made textiles. The prices have been going up the last few years, but FabIndia is the only source for this sort of textile in Chennai at any retail outlet.
</li><li><b>Just Casuals</b>, Nungambakkam, 1, Sterling Road, +91 044 28273882. A good place to head if you're in the mood for the Banana Republic/Abercrombie/Old Navy/Gap type stuff. They seem to get all the export rejects or overstocks. You'll find that all the brand tags are cut out due to some agreement with the manufacturer. The quality and prices are good, but unfortunately there's no bargaining possible.
</li><li><b>Handloom Exhibitions</b>. Year-round there is always a handloom exhibition profiling the work of one state or the other. These temporary installations (you'll have to check the local papers to find out where they set up) generally have a good selection of interesting fabrics and textile products. And there is always the option to bargain, which makes it a better bet than oft-overpriced retail stores. The Royapettah YMCA (across from Royapettah Hospital) has a regular handloom exhibition.
</li><li><b>Shanti Colony</b>, Annanagar is a hub for "seconds" clothing as in the above description for "Just Casuals".

<p>Chennai is a difficult place to drink. Government rule states that only establishments with a minimum of 21 rooms can obtain a bar/ liquor license. Hence there are no standalone bars or pubs here. All the bars hat are around are part of some hotel or the other and in general overpriced.
Government run liquor stores called TASMAC are all over the place but in general not at all a pleasant experience. They usually have rude staff, are filthy and usually never have the brand of your choice. Also they always tend to mark up each bottle by Rs 5 to 10 over the listed price. Go for it ifyou want a one time war like experience in order to obtain some booze!
</p><p>Nightclubs close at 23.00, even on fridays and saturdays, due to government rule.

<p>Chennai is generally a safer area of India in terms of crime, although pickpocketing, muggings, and robberies sporadically occur. Keep your doors and windows shut and locked at night and do not carry or display large amounts of cash if possible.
</p><p>It is advisable for women, especially unaccompanied ones, to dress modestly and limit their interaction with unfamiliar local men. Foreigners are generally overcharged by autorickshaws simply because they are ignorant of the prevailing fares. It is necessary to confirm whether the driver knows the exact destination and to fix the fare before boarding. 'Autos', as autorickshaws are known in Chennai, are notorious for fleecing customers, tourists and locals alike.
</p><p>Be alert to your surroundings and watch where you step, especially if you get caught in a large crowd where it is difficult to look at what is in front of you. Cross streets extremely carefully as traffic is generally heavy. On major roads, use the underground crossings (locally called "subways"). Avoid using underground road-crossing/ subways in the night or if you notice them to be empty. Traffic signals are frequently ignored by drivers and pedestrians alike, and it is not at all advisable for tourists to try driving in Chennai.
</p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Chennai&amp;action=edit&amp;section=57" title="Edit section: Stay healthy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Stay_healthy">Stay healthy</span></h2>
<p>While in Chennai it is advisable to <b>drink only bottled water</b>. Do <b>not</b> trust water from small local restaurants as it may be from the tap, and avoid cold or iced drinks that are not commercially sold (Bigger chains of eatieries and juice shops can be trusted to an extent). Eating fresh vegetables and fruits that have sat outside in the presence of insects can also be unhealthy, although bananas and coconuts are usually safe because they are opened only immediately before eating. Hot drinks in restaurants such as tea, coffee, and other local specialties are safe, as are packaged/bottled drinks such as Aquafina water, Frooti (a popular local mango drink) and others. If you have access to a stove, boiling tap water before drinking is also an option. Never eat from roadside shops as the food is prepared in the most unhygienic conditions.
</p><p>Chennai summers are humid and sultry; it's better to step out with an <b>umbrella</b>, <b>bottled water</b> and some <b>oral rehydration salts</b> (available from pharmacies, the brand name is Electral). These come in handy if you happen to get dehydrated.
</p><p>Chennai is the medical capital of South East Asia.

</p><p>It is best to change money at the city based money changers than the ones located at the airports. The ones at the airport offer much less for exchanging forex into Indian Rupees and sell forex for a much higher rate than the market rate.

<p>Even as recently as about ten years ago, the ECR, which was then known as the New Mahabalipuram Road, had nothing much to offer by way of entertainment, except for VGP Golden Beach and Romulus Whittaker's crocodile bank. Further down, the road led you to Mahabalipuram, and that was that. 
</p><p>The scenario that meets a traveller today is entirely different. The East Coast Road could very well be termed the entertainment highway of Chennai. The road is brand new, flanked by the sea on the left and dotted with amusement spots through the entire stretch. Driving down ECR is an experience. Really! 
</p><p>You can pick and choose from Amusement Parks, Water Sports Centres, Beaches, Eco Conservation, Cultural and Religious Centres, Restaurants or Resorts to spend your day in. The road caters to practically every type of pastime that one could think about.
</p><p><b>Amusement Parks, Water Sports Centres, Beaches:</b> 
<b>Prarthana Drive In Theatre:</b> Approximately 10 Kms out of Adyar, this complex offers both a drive in theatre and a drive in restaurant VGP 
</p><p><b>Golden Beach:</b> The first amusement park in Chennai, just about 11 Kms away from Adyar. Still a landmark of Chennai, this park offers over 40 odd rides for the fun seeker. The only park with an access to the beach 
</p><p><b>Ahaa Water Park:</b> A spot for frolicking in water, the Ahaa Water Park offers a variety of water sports and fun activities. It has a wave generator, which can generate waves of up to 3.5ft. 
</p><p><b>Kart Attack:</b> A centre dedicated to fulfilling the speed maniac's desire for thrill in a safe and secure environment. The first go karting centre of Chennai, this has placed Chennai on the go karting map of India, and has been instrumental in creating a few go karting champions also. 
</p><p><b>Radio Control Car Racing at ECR RC Track:</b> Chennai has the only active RC Car race track in India. On a weekend, you can find several RC car racers at the ECR RC Track located near Hot Kitchen Resatuarant on the ECR Road. It is very close to Kart Attack track. Visit IRCRA on Facebook for more details. 
</p><p><b>Mayajaal:</b> 100,000 sq.ft of air-conditioned space. A multitude of activities and entertainment avenues, including movie theatres, bowling alleys, video games parlours, multicuisine food courts, and much more. This is Mayajaal, a multidimensional entertainment centre, on par with any entertainment zone found abroad. Open from 11AM to 11PM you can easily spend the entire day here. It offers that much and more. 
</p><p><b>MGM Dizzee World:</b> Spread over 27 acres, this theme park offers joy rides, food stalls and other games. It features one of the first roller coaster rides of Chennai, and many of the rides offered could make your hair stand on edge. On the softer side, you have the dashing car drives, and the swimming pool with its water slides.  MGM Dizzee World is in <a href="/en/Muttukadu" title="Muttukadu">Muttukadu</a> next to MGM Beach Resort.
</p><p><b>Little Folks &amp; Dolphin City:</b> Specifically aimed at providing entertainment for the children, this park has a longer history than MGM. Dolphin city was closed <a href="http://www.petaindia.com/903dolphincity.html" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[118]</a> after all of it's dolphins and sea lions had died. It is no longer operational now.
</p><p><b>Muttukadu Boat House:</b> Located at 23 Kms from Adayar, this backwater area is maintained by the Tamilnadu Tourism Development Corporation, and offers rowing and speedboat riding. 
</p><p><b>Eco Conservation, Cultural and Religious Centres:</b> 
<b>Marundeswarar Temple</b> is the first temple that one comes across on the route. A Shiva temple having a rich sthala purana or location history. 
</p><p><b>Sai Baba Temple:</b> Approximately 8.5 kms from Adyar, the temple is peaceful, clean and breezy. 
</p><p><b>Jagannathan Temple:</b> An exact replica of the Puri Jagannath Temple. Those who have not been to Puri can take a look at this temple. 
</p><p><b>Cholamandalam Artists Village:</b> Set up by a group of artists to serve as a recluse for artists of all genres. This village offers the ambience needed for creativity to flow and is inhabited only by artists. The village offers guesthouse facilities exclusively for artists from elsewhere so that they could also benefit from the environment provided by the place. A must visit for those who appreciate the finer things of life. 
</p><p><b>Tiruvidanthai Nithya Kalyana Perumal Koil:</b> As the name denotes, a temple dedicated to Lord Venkateshwara found on East Coast Road. 
</p><p><b>Crocodile Bank:</b> The brainchild of Romulus Whittaker, the acknowledged specialist on reptiles, this center has gained fame as an endeavor for the preservation and propagation of endangered species of crocodiles. The center also houses a large variety of snakes. To get to Crocodile Bank from Chennai (Triplicane), you need to get on the PP19/B/X bus (runs along the beach) to Kovalum, which is the last stop for <a href="/en/Indian_rupee" title="Indian rupee"><img alt="Indian rupee" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/56/Indian_Rupee_symbol.png/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.png" width="7" height="10" style="vertical-align: baseline" /></a>14 (75mins/30km).  Then at this same intersection, get on 588/C/X bus to Mamallapurum (7Km/7mins) for <a href="/en/Indian_rupee" title="Indian rupee"><img alt="Indian rupee" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/56/Indian_Rupee_symbol.png/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.png" width="7" height="10" style="vertical-align: baseline" /></a>14/18AC.  The entry fee is <a href="/en/Indian_rupee" title="Indian rupee"><img alt="Indian rupee" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/56/Indian_Rupee_symbol.png/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.png" width="7" height="10" style="vertical-align: baseline" /></a>35locals/60foreigners w/ a <a href="/en/Indian_rupee" title="Indian rupee"><img alt="Indian rupee" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/56/Indian_Rupee_symbol.png/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.png" width="7" height="10" style="vertical-align: baseline" /></a>20 still camera/ <a href="/en/Indian_rupee" title="Indian rupee"><img alt="Indian rupee" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/56/Indian_Rupee_symbol.png/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.png" width="7" height="10" style="vertical-align: baseline" /></a>40 video camera fee.  Some people know it as a farm/park rather than a bank if you are asking for directions.  <a href="http://www.madrascrocodilebank.org/Aboutus.htm" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[119]</a> 
</p><p><b>Dakshinachitra:</b> A venture of Deborah Thiagarajan and her associates from the Madras Craft Foundation. Dakshinachitra is an amazing place to visit, as various kinds of traditional houses have been transported to Chennai from interior parts of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala and rebuilt here piece by piece. 
</p><p><b>Mahabalipuram:</b> 
The internationally recognized heritage monument of our country, personifying the art and culture of the Pallava kings.  One of the most famous temples here is the <b>Shore Temple</b> and is next to the beach.  If coming from Chennai ensure you reach this temple between 6AM to 6PM, as it is shut down after 6PM.  Also, keep in mind that it takes roughly an hour to reach Mahabalipuram from Chennai. 
</p><p><b>Hotels and Restaurants in ECR:</b> The ECR road abounds with restaurants and eating spots, which offer a wide range of cuisines and tasteful ambience. And you can plan your dinner or lunch in one of these hotels. 
A few of the food outlets are listed below: 
<i>-Basera </i>
-Blue Lagoon -Thanjavur Restaurant 
-Food Village -Coastal Kitchen 
-Hot Kitchen 
</p><p><br />
<b>Beach Resorts:</b> Another convenience that is found in plenty on the East Coast Road is the presence of several comfortable, pleasing, beach resorts, which enable you to take a break, and enjoy a seaside environment. Take your pick from those mentioned below: 
<i>-Buena Vista </i>
-Blue Lagoon 
-Green Country Resort 
-Fisherman's Cove 
-Casuarina Bay
</p><p><b>Drive your way to fun and thrill</b>. But be prepared to pay a small toll fee on the East Coast Road.

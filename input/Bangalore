<p><b>Bengaluru</b> <a href="http://kstdc.nic.in/frames3.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://kstdc.nic.in/frames3.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (Kannada: ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು), formerly known as <b>Bangalore</b>, is the capital of the Indian state of <a href="/en/Karnataka" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>.
</p>
<a name="Understand"></a><h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangalore&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="Edit section: Understand">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Understand</span></h2>
<p>Once called the "Garden City of India" and the "Pensioner's Paradise", these epithets no longer apply to Bengaluru, which is today a large cosmopolitan city with diminishing green spaces and a large working population. Bengaluru is the major centre of India's IT industry, popularly known as the <i>Silicon Valley of India</i>.
</p>
<a name="History"></a><h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangalore&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h3>
<p>The earliest records of a place named 'Bengaluru' are found in a 9th century temple in an area that is now known as 'Old Bangalore'. 
</p><p>Legend has it that the feudal lord Kempe Gowda was once hunting in this area, a rabbit turned and attacked his dog. This made a great impression on Gowda and he gave the place a title of <i>gandu bhoomi</i> (the place of heroes) and in 1537, with the assistance of the local king, he constructed three districts protected by a walled fort on the site.
</p><p>During the next three centuries, Bengaluru existed very much in the shadow of its neighboring city <a href="/en/Mysore" title="Mysore">Mysore</a>, and control of the town changed hands many times. The year 1831 marked a major turning point for the city. Claiming misrule by the king Krishna Raja Wodeyar III, the British took control of the Mysore Kingdom and, possibly influenced by the city's salubrious climate, moved the administrative capital to Bengaluru. New telecommunication systems were laid, rail connections built, fine government buildings constructed, and the city's famous parks and gardens established. After independence, Bengaluru maintained its position as the <a href="/en/Karnataka" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> state capital, and continues to flourish. 
</p><p>For many years, Bengaluru was known throughout India as the most green, liberal and forward-thinking city. In recent years, these attributes have propelled Bengaluru to the forefront of the high-tech industry boom in India, and it currently ranks as India's most developed city and one of the world's fastest growing urban areas.  
</p><p>The name Bangalore appears to come from an Anglicisation of the native name "Bengaluru" - an adaptation of the earlier name in Kannada: <i>Benda Kaalu Uru</i> (The Town of Boiled Beans). Apparently this rather humble name was bequeathed to the city by King Vira Ballala. Once while lost in the area, he was offered boiled beans by an old woman, and it was out of gratitude that he named the area after this simple offering.

<p>Unlike other parts of India which are extremely hot in the summer months, Bengaluru enjoys a relatively mild climate year round.
</p>
<ul><li> Summer - February to May (peak temperature is during April and May)
</li><li> Monsoon - June to October (the heaviest rains are typically between June and August)
</li><li> Winter - November to January (with December being the coldest month)
</li></ul>
<p>Summer temperatures can reach upto 36°C (97°F) and early morning temperatures in the winter hovers around 12°C (54°F).

<p>Being the capital of Karnataka, the official language in Bengaluru is <b><a href="/en/Kannada_phrasebook" title="Kannada phrasebook">Kannada</a></b>. However, most educated people are also able to speak English. Other languages such as Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu, and Tamil are also spoken natively by the various migrant communities. Also, Bengaluru being the cultural hub that it is, has a smattering of  Tulu and Konkani speakers.
</p><p>Most retail and entertainment transactions in the city center are conducted in English, as are most signs written in English alongside Kannada.
</p><p>Although autorickshaw drivers understand English numbers, a basic knowledge of Kannada will help in ensuring that you are not overcharged.

A total of 156 buses ply to and from the airport. 40 of these buses are air-conditioned Volvo buses, called Vayu Vajra. The cost for each trip in these buses ranges between Rs 50-250 depending on the distance. This is the cheapest and an extremely convenient way to get to the airport moreover, this service is available everyday, day and night. While taking this mode be aware that you will need some one to pick you up from the bus stop or you will need a auto rickshaw ride for the last mile.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Post-paid taxi</b> BLR has selected Meru and EasyCabs to provide basic taxi services. The taxi operators will have basic A/C cars, all equipped with tracking devices to ensure safety and transparency. Both operators have professional call centres. Hence, guests traveling to the airport can call the cab call centres and a cab will pick them up and drop them at the airport. Meru Cabs have been reported to be highly un-reliable by users.They have been known to cancel the appointment at the last hour leaving the customer high and dry. The Meru Cab drivers do this if they find a better deal from a street pick up while they are on their way to an airport pick-up. For travellers arriving at the airport, there is a dedicated taxi holding area. The post paid taxi facility will be available on meter charges @ Rs 20/- per km (subject to Govt regulation). These are by far the best and most convenient mode of transport from the airport. It may cost you approximately Rs 600 to get to Bengaluru's CBD. About Rs 700 to Koramangala.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Share Taxis</b> are operated by Airlift. As soon as you exit the airport terminal, look for the bus stand with the bright red Volvo buses. The share taxis are yellow and red Toyota Innovas parked just next to the buses. These are very convenient and cheaper than a regular taxi as a one way drop to Bengaluru's CBD will cost around Rs 300. These are air conditioned and offer each passenger a personal television screen. (Dis-functional as of now) This service has ceased to operate.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Pre-paid taxi</b> Hertz and Akbar Travels provide pre paid Limousine and car rental facilities through counters at the terminal building. These cost above Rs 1,200 to CBD
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Self drive cars</b> will also be available on self drive basis. There will be three ranges of self drive cars - the compact category (Suzuki Swift), the intermediate range (Ford Fiesta), the standard category (Toyota corolla), Multi Utility Vehicles (Toyota Innova) and Sports Utility Vehicles (Ford Endeavour).  These cars will be given to the renter with a full fuel tank and the car has to be returned with full fuel tank. A flexible pick up and drop off facility in town and at the airport will be offered. The renter can pick up the car at the airport and then drop it off anywhere in the city or in Hyderabad or Chennai. Similarly, the car can be picked up at any of these cities and dropped off at the airport. Conditions apply (the renter must be over 21 yrs of age and possess a valid Indian license). In India it is not as easy as in the west. One needs to to do a lot of paper work and depending on the company and type of car you want to rent a large deposit will be required. Please check well in advance before making plans. Much easier to rent a chauffeur driven taxi.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Hotel pick-up</b> Another option is to arrange with your hotel in Bengaluru to have a driver pick you up at the airport. Some hotels, especially the higher-end ones, provide this service for free if you are staying with them. If it's your first time traveling to Bengaluru, this is the recommended way to get from the airport to your hotel. The driver will be found outside the airport with a card bearing your name, the only difficulty being that about 100 other drivers will also be waiting outside the airport, all vying for your attention. Luckily there is a short fenced walkway that separates the drivers from those leaving the airport, giving you ample time and space to find your ride into Bengaluru. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Taxi (other)</b> You can still find a ride into Bengaluru City in your own taxi at a much cheaper rate than the above options, if you are willing to take the risk involved. Taxi drivers not approved by the airport will attempt to negotiate with you a much lower fare than the approved EasyCabs and Meru cabs, and may come down to as much as Rs 200-300 for a ride to Bengaluru's CBD. One really has to bargain very hard or you will be taken for a ride. These drivers can be found just beyond the terminal plaza at the covered walkway that leads to the parking lots. Once you leave the walkway, some drivers may become fairly aggressive, and might try to take your bag without your permission. The best thing to do is to keep track of, and be in control of, your belongings. Even the most aggressive taxi driver or tout will leave you alone if you stand firm and make it clear that you do not want their help. It is recommended to fix the price before you enter the cab and no tip is necessary once you arrive at your destination. Do not opt for this mode if you are not familiar with rates.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> If you are in a hurry and have a lot of money, <b>helicopter services</b> are offered by Deccan Aviation and Birdie. There are eight helipads across Bangalore and a ride from the international airport sets you back by about Rs 5,000. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> A <b>high-speed electric train</b> is planned to connect the airport with the city, cutting travel time to about 22 min, but no date of completion has been announced. A new express toll road is also planned to connect the airport to the city's ring road at Hennur.

<p>The Bangalore Metro is a new suburban rail service that will cut down the time taken to get from one area of the city to the other.
</p><p>Bengaluru has two major railway terminals. The Bengaluru City (IR station code: SBC) railway station is situated in the heart of the city, opposite the Majestic Bus stand. Most trains, both local and long-distance, arrive and depart from here. The other terminal is Yeswantpur Junction (IR station code: YPR) located on NH-4 (Tumkur Road). A few (mostly long-distance) trains arrive and depart from here. Two smaller railway terminals are Bengaluru East (IR station code: BNCE) and Bengaluru Cantonment (IR station code: BNC).Of late Krishnarajapuram (KJM) has become an important stop owing to proximity of IT companies and the ring road just passing close to the station and well connected by buses to major parts. It also forms the 1st stop for majority trains leaving Yeshvantapur towards Jolarpettai. 
</p><p>Bookings can be done at either the railway stations or at the Indian Railways booking counters located in major commercial residential areas. Booking can also be done online <a href="http://www.irctc.co.in" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.irctc.co.in" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>. Note that if you are booking at Bengaluru City and are traveling to Mysore, there is a separate counter for travellers to Mysore. This is to cater for the large amount of travelers between Bengaluru and Mysore. If travelling to Mysore on a Sunday afternoon, arrive early as there is usually a long line for buying tickets.
</p><p>As with all Indian railway travel, have some patience for delays. Trains are usually on time (within 20 mins of scheduled time), but can sometimes be late. A digital departure board in the station will tell you what platform your train is on and what time it leaves.
</p><p>Train travel is usually fairly cheap. For example, a ticket to Chennai, about 360 km (5-6 hr) away, costs anywhere from Rs 125 for the lowest class to Rs 1,105 for the highest class.
</p><p>For train arrival/departure and PNR status inquiries at various railway stations at Bengaluru, call 139.
</p><p>Travelling from <a href="/en/Mumbai" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> to Bengaluru by train takes a long time (24 hrs or so). Buses are comparatively faster and take 18-20 hrs, provided there are no traffic jams in Mumbai and Pune enroute. Effective travel time by both train or bus is long. Air travel is recommended for traveling between Mumbai and Bengaluru, the duration of which is about 90 min.  Low cost airlines charge the same fare as A/C train or Volvo bus<i>. However, sleeper class (non-A/C) train travel from Mumbai to Bengaluru is economical and you can have a view of some lush evergreen forests and river valleys across Western India.</i>

<p>If you have difficulty in arranging a plane or railway ticket to your next destination, or you prefer a little more adventure, you can go by bus. There are both government and private buses that run services to major cities like Mumbai, Goa, Chennai, Mangalore, Coimbatore, Madurai etc. Buses can be a normal luxury bus, a Volvo A/C bus or a sleeper bus for night travel.

<p>All intercity buses arrive and depart from Bengaluru bus stand, which is located opposite the Bengaluru city railway station. The bus station is named after the founder of Bengaluru, 
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Kempegowda Bus Station</b>, is more commonly known as the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation <b>(<i>KSRTC</i>) bus stand</b> or the <b>Majestic Bus Station</b>. It handles buses that connect Bengaluru to all major cities and states in south India. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (<i>BMTC</i>)</b>, maintains bus services within Bengaluru. The main bus stand is located next to the Kempegowda Bus Station. 
</li></ul>
<p>Unlike other metros, the display boards in the bus show the destination in the local language <b>Kannada</b>. But the bus numbers are mostly in English. If you don't speak Kannada, you will likely need to get some help to get on the right bus. However, the newer Volvo buses are all equipped with electronic displays that display the destination and route numbers in both Kannada <i>and</i> English. Non-Volvo buses are being gradually retrofitted with these electronic displays; this should make bus travel much simpler if you are unfamiliar with the local language.

<p>Driving in India can be very stressful. Use of the horn is mandatory in all situations. Lane discipline is practically nonexistent, and games of chicken, combined with razor thin passing margins are common. One ride in a taxi will most likely convince you that driving yourself is not worth the risk, so if you do want to arrive by car, you will probably want to hire both a car and a driver. Cost varies, but most car/driver combinations cost Rs 1,400-1,700/day. The fares for hired private taxis are usually in the multiples of 4 hr/40 km, fares for which start at around Rs 450 for a non-air conditioned small car. Depending on where you are coming from, you may be able to negotiate a lower fare if the trip isn't far, and it may be a higher fare if you are traveling far and your driver has to travel back on his own time. Although it costs more, consider requesting an air conditioned car if you aren't used to the heat, especially in summer. An air conditioned car will also help filter out the air pollution, which is considerable, especially on congested roadways. If you want something even more special, such as a fancy car or SUV, be prepared to pay extra.

<p><b>Buses</b>  in Bengaluru are cheap and usually frequent,(though compared to other states the fares are highest here) but traveling on them can be very difficult if you don't know the system well. Ordinary city buses display only the route number in English, with the destination and route information written in Kannada. This means you will have to know what route number you need before you get on, which you can find from the BMTC website <a href="http://www.bmtcinfo.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bmtcinfo.com/" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, Desiroutes <a href="http://narasimhadatta.info" class="external autonumber" title="http://narasimhadatta.info" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> bus routes or by asking locals. Unlike many Western countries, posted route maps of the bus system are rare, although maps are sold at the main bus terminals (Kempegowda Bus Stand and Shivajinagar). ☎ BMTC toll free 1800 425 1663. <i>Bangalore Bus Route Search</i> <a href="http://www.narasimhadatta.info/bmtc_query.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.narasimhadatta.info/bmtc_query.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> also has a webpage with a route number search function.
</p><p>Buses with black display boards run within the city. Red board buses covers long distance and go to adjoining suburbs. The ordinary city buses are white and blue in color. The newer city buses tend to be blue in colour (Purchased under the JNNURM fund provided by Central govt. )and have LED display boards. There is a bus service called <b>Pushpak</b> with better seating; these buses are tan rather than the usual blue and are slightly more expensive. There are red Volvo buses, called <b>Vajra</b>, that operate on certain routes within the city. They offer a comfortable air-conditioned ride at slightly higher prices than the regular buses (which are not air-conditioned). These are a great way to get around the city. Unlike most other buses, the Vajras have illuminated LED display boards on the front and sides which display the destination and route information in English as well as Kannada.
</p><p>New bus services are introduced from time to time by the BMTC. The latest service introduced in early 2009 known as <b>Big 10</b> <a href="http://btis.in/big10" class="external autonumber" title="http://btis.in/big10" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> consists of ten routes along major roads into the city, bringing passengers from the outer suburbs to central Bengaluru. These buses are green in color, have LCD destination boards, and prominently feature the Big 10 logo on the sides. More information about these buses, including stops and route maps. BIG 10 service starts at Brigade road junction.
There are also couple of buses which do a circular route around the CBD. 
</p><p>City buses are crowded during rush hours but one can travel with little difficulty during the daytime. Many have seats reserved for women in the front. Bus service is less frequent after 9:30-10PM and becomes rare after 10:30PM.
</p><p>It is always better to buy a daily pass if you plan to travel the whole day on the bus. The daily pass costs Rs Rs 40 as of March 10th, 2011 and it comes handy if you need to travel on several buses in a single day. Daily passes are issued by the on-duty bus conductor or at the bus stand. Using this pass you can travel in any bus (other than the Vajra) for the entire day, any number of times. It is a very economical option for travel in Bengaluru. Senior citizens are given 25% concession in all buses on production of valid ID card(Voter ID,PAN,Passport etc). children between age of 4-12 are given 50% concession. No charge for children upto 4 years of age
</p><p>There are three major bus stands: 
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Kempegowda bus stand</b>, also known as the Majestic Bus Stand, near Gandhi Nagar is directly opposite the Bengaluru City railway station. It is quite neatly organized and is easily navigable. There is an inquiry office near platform number 1 on ‘Majestic’ where you can ask the bus number and platform for your desired destination. You can find a large map on display, which you can use to find the bus number you need to take if you know the area you are going to. You can of course always ask the conductor or other passengers. Route maps are also sold on the platforms.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>City Market</b> is around 2 km (1.2 mi) to 3 km (1.8 mi) away from Majestic and could daunt newcomers, since it is very disorganized. It is a large dirt parking lot under an overhead highway, and there isn't much order to where buses park.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Shivajinagar</b> is in the north. This is also neatly organized and there is an inquiry window to find about buses. You can find a large map on display here too, which you can use to find the bus number you need to take if you know the area you are going to.  Route maps are also sold on the platforms.
</li></ul>
<p>Buses are available to all major localities of the city from these three bus stands. There have been lot of developments due to the ongoing metro project as well as efforts to decongest the city. BMTC is adding more bus stations all the time. Better to check on their website for latest sistuation.  
</p><p>Other important bus stands are:
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Chandra Layout</b> West
</li><li> <b>Shantinagar</b>, Central
</li><li> <b>Jayanagar</b>, South
</li><li> <b>Banashankari</b>, South

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Autorickshaws and taxis in Bengaluru have a metered fare system. Tipping is neither expected nor required when you avail of autorickshaw or taxi services. Just pay the meter fare. Refrain from tipping and ruining things for the residents who will then be the at the receiving end of unwarranted demands for tips.

<a name="By_auto-rickshaw"></a><h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangalore&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14" title="Edit section: By auto-rickshaw">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">By auto-rickshaw</span></h3>
<p>Auto-rickshaw drivers are the horrible nightmare of the city, and even if you live here they can be the most difficult group of people to deal with. Poor etiquette and the inexplicable reasons offered by them for refusing to ferry customers have earned them well deserved brick-bats. 
</p><p>Auto-rickshaws  are everywhere at any time of day. They are green-and-yellow, and black-and-yellow three wheeled contraptions that use simple two-stroke engines. Nevertheless, they are a fast way to get around the city.
</p><p>Auto-rickshaws are supposed to charge fares as per the meter reading, which most often equals to Rs 9 x distance (in kilometres) (Minimum charge of Rs 17 for the first 2 km or less), they generally tend to charge on an ad-hoc basis depending on the distance of the destination, the chances of getting another customer from the mentioned locality, and their mood. You should simply refuse to board an auto where the meter is faulty or the driver refuses to use it. Saying "meter please" will usually do the trick. 
</p><p>Tourists should be cautious when approaching an auto-rickshaw during night, or during heavy rains. Chances are they will charge exorbitant rates. Help could be taken from the local traffic police to avail auto-rickshaws during such circumstances. If you are a visitor and do not know the route to the destination it is a good idea to bargain and fix the fare before boarding to avoid long, convoluted routes being used by the driver.
</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is to be firm but not loud in an argument while travelling in the auto. Some of the less reputable drivers may team up with their friends midway to cause problems. Remember that although Bangaloreans are known for their polite and mild mannered behaviour, auto drivers are normally an exception. Some will think nothing of trying to rip you off. If in doubt, consult a local or your hotel travel desk. 
</p><p>If a rickshaw driver offers to show/drive you to some great places to shop, firmly refuse.  A common tactic is to drive you to local shops where you will be pressured to buy Indian crafts that you probably don't want.  Know your destination and insist upon it. Be firm.
</p><p>Autos add a 50% surcharge after 10PM (called "one and a half" and is the legal charge). Some drivers may demand 100% surcharge after 10PM or 11PM but you must refuse to board in such a case. Heavy luggage costs an additional fee of around Rs 10-20.
</p><p>Rickshaw drivers are required by law to display their identification on the dashboard or the back of their seats. Refuse to get into a rickshaw that does not display one.
</p><p>If an auto driver is problematic, note their identification number and report to the BBMP Control room which is empowerd to withdraw their auto license. This is a very effective technique to deal with them. The BBMP control room number as of December 2009 is ☎+91 80 22975803.
</p><p>The minimum charge as of November 2010, is Rs 17 for the first 2 km and Rs 9 for every additional kilometre.
</p>
<a name="By_taxi"></a><h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangalore&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15" title="Edit section: By taxi">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">By taxi</span></h3>
<p>The taxis in Bengaluru are very convenient and comfortable. Most of the vehicles are Maruti Omni Vans, Tata Indica cars or Mahindra Logan cars, which are much safer than Auto rickshaws, and  the drivers are polite. If you are alone or going to an unknown destination, you are strongly advised to choose this option, even though the rates will be double that of an auto.  Most taxi companies will charge a flat rate of Rs 150 for a pick-up and drop from anywhere to anywhere within city limits. Waiting or return trips will be charged extra, as will a lot of heavy luggage.
</p><p>Unlike many other countries, taxis are <b>not</b> marked with 'TAXI' signs on the top. Instead, the cars will be marked with the logo of the fleet operator or taxi company on the sides of the car. Some companies have a yellow sign with a identification number (usually an alphabet followed by two digits) on the top. Keep in mind that these taxis cannot be hailed from the street, but have to be called by telephone. When you call, you must give the operator your location, destination as well as phone number, who will in turn tell you the charge (or will inform you that you must go by the meter) as well as the taxi number. The taxi will come pick you up, and call you when they are close. When you go out on the street, look at the license plate for the number they gave you -- it will be the last four digits of the license plate. Alternatively, look for the yellow board atop the car with the taxi's identification number.
</p><p>The license plate number is usually in the format "KA" followed by 01 to 05, followed by two alphabets, followed by a four digit number. Taxis generally have yellow license plates with black letters. 
</p><p>Be prepared to book a taxi a couple of hours in advance if required on weekdays, especially during rush hours, as a huge demand for the taxis, coupled with massive traffic jams during rush hours will ensure that it would be difficult for a taxi to reach you in time. Private taxis are generally more reliable during this time as in many cases, radio cabs (run by Meru, EasyCabs, KSTDC and others) will be overbooked and you might be unfortunate to be informed that your booking has been scrapped.
</p><p>Although it can be hard for non-Indians to grasp at first, the system is actually very effective. If in doubt, ask a member of your hotel staff to help you, and when your taxi comes be sure to tip them Rs 35-Rs 40 for the assistance.

<p>Most taxi and auto-rickshaw drivers will be more than happy to offer you either a daily rate or an hourly rate, and take you around wherever you need to go. Alternately, your hotel or a travel company can arrange a private car. 
</p><p>If you find a good taxi or auto driver, this can be a great way to go for a foreigner. You'll certainly pay a lot more than if you bought individual rides, but you'll always have a driver waiting for you, and he can help with recommending local tourist sites, finding a good restaurant to eat at, and otherwise coping with day-to-day life. This can take a lot of the stress out of traveling.
</p><p>Rates are generally something like Rs 50 to 100 per hour for an auto-rickshaw, and Rs 150 to 250 per hour for a taxi. Rates for a private car booked via the hotel will probably be more. Like everything else in India, rates are very fluid.

<p>Although Bengaluru is not known as a tourist city, there is still a lot to see. If you only have a limited amount of time in the city, you should consider taking a tour.
</p><p>Typically, the city tours do <b>NOT</b> include entry fees into the attractions. Bengaluru, as with the rest of India, has a habit of charging foreigners a lot more than locals. For example, Tipu Sultan's Palace, which is on the half-day tour, charges Rs 10 for Indians and Rs 100 (or US$2) to non-Indians.

<p><b>Non-Indian Citizen Employment Regulation</b>
</p><p>Indian regulations may require that any foreign national who is employed in India earn at least US$25,000/year. This is exempted for (a) Ethnic chefs, (b) Language teachers (other than English language teachers) / translators and (c) Staff working for Embassy/High Commissions. Check your compensation offer so that you meet this requirement and are eligible for an employment visa.  Some foreign nationals are employed at salaries less than this, though, typically in the NGO sector.

<p>With a little hard work and persistence finding a job is quite possible in Bengaluru. Most of the available positions are in the IT field but not necessarily IT based. Several expats do marketing, quality assurance, accent training and translation among other things. All jobs in India require an employment visa which must be obtained abroad and sponsored by the hiring company in India. In general, the salary for expats is very high compared to the local Indian wage. The best resource for jobs is through the expat community. Ask around but a good place to meet expacts is the Sunday brunches at the 5 Star hotels or at the numerous coffee shops in and around the MG Road area.

<p>Bengaluru provides a wide range of options for shoppers. One can buy many things ranging from clothing to electronic goods and vehicles. Being an IT city, Bengaluru provides all kind of services but one might find things to be costlier.
</p><p>Many visitors come to Bengaluru searching only for sandalwood carvings and silk saris and so miss out on the true Bengaluru shopping experience. Here is a low down on shopping - Bengaluru style:
</p><p>The <b>UB City</b> and <b>Vittal Mallya Road</b> are Page-3 shopping areas. You'll find brands like Versace, Louis Vuitton, Kimaya in the UB City. Vittal Mallya Road's got shopping places like <b>The Collective</b> which is a shop only for men, too bad!. Armani, Versace, Boss, you name it they have it. There's even Canary Blue and Esprit on the same road.
</p><p>The <b>M.G Road/Brigade Road</b> area is the most popular place for tourists, and these two roads are filled with shops of every kind, whether it be traditional handicrafts or the latest western wear (this is especially true for Brigade Road).
</p><p><b>Bannerghatta Road</b>, newly improved. You have 'Grasshopper,' a space that exhibits clothing designs from the most experimental designers in India and also showcases other ideas - lighting design, products, theatre, music - an open space for expression! If that's too boring, you can keep driving and you have a thousand ways that you can take to enjoy the wildlife and the myriad reservoirs strewn across the area - you can still find your very own private haven. Enjoy
</p><p><b>Brigade Road</b> used to be where British soldiers bought their necessities. Today Brigade Road is the centre of yuppie Bengaluru; you'll see hordes of college students on the road anytime of day or night. Some of the stores on Brigade Road include: Planet M (a huge music store with everything),Tommy Hilfiger, Louis Phillipe, Pepe Jeans, Levis,Lee, SanFrisco Jeans, Nike, Titan (great Indian made watches) just to name a few.
</p><p>There are also many eateries on the road and on the side roads that lead off of Brigade road, so that you can refuel yourself for shopping! There are your fast food outlets: KFC (right at the entrance), Pizza Hut at the other end of the road and many cafes including the Indian Coffee Chain Cafe Coffee Day. Also includes a tattoo studio. 
</p><p><b>Commercial Street</b> a legacy of the British is another shopping mecca that sells international brands (similar to Brigade road) alongside locally produced items. Commercial Street has more of a bazaar feel than Brigade Road. In addition, it is famous for its  body piercing centers. The price of goods here is very competitive and it is a great place to pick a bargain.

<a name="Shopping_malls_and_markets"></a><h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangalore&amp;action=edit&amp;section=39" title="Edit section: Shopping malls and markets">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Shopping malls and markets</span></h3>
<p>Go <b>shopping</b> at one of Bengaluru's many malls and traditional markets. Malls typically have high(er)-end stores retailing apparel, footwear, and consumer electronics. Many malls also have food courts (with international cuisine) and movie theaters. Finding a parking spot for your car may not be easy though, especially on weekends. Some of the more popular malls in Bengaluru are: 
</p>
<ul><li> The Forum (Koramangala)
</li><li> Garuda Mall (Magrath Road)
</li><li> Mantri Mall (Malleshwaram)
</li><li> Bengaluru Central (Residency Road and Jayanagar 9th block)
</li><li> Sigma Mall (Cunningham Road)
</li><li> Poorva Mall (Old Madras Road)
</li><li> Lido Mall (Ulsoor)
</li><li> Mega Mall (Vyalikaval)
</li><li> Prestige Mall (Vittal Mallya Road)
</li><li> Gopalan Innovation Mall (Bannerghatta Road)
</li><li> Meenakshi Mall (Bannerghatta Road)'
</li></ul>
<p><b>Malls</b> in India are a recent phenomenon, the first opened back in 1999, since then there has been a boom with malls around every corner in large cities (now also in smaller cities). Bengaluru is no exception! Here is list of the major Malls in Bengaluru, but beware that there are at least a dozen in the planning and construction stages!
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Forum Mall</b> - The Forum on Hosur road is in the upmarket suburb of Koramangla, fast becoming a key shopping hub in Bengaluru. It is the largest mall in Bengaluru, covering an area of 650 000 ft² (60 000m²) of retail space.  Again like other shopping areas, you can find anything at the Forum, high international brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Swarovski Crystals to traditional Indian Khadi clothing at the Khadder. Other brands with outlets include: United Colours of Bennetton (much cheaper here than in the west), Pepe Jeans U.K, William Penn, Wrangler Jeans, Weekender and of course Nike. The Forum incorporates the clothing from international brands as well as haute couture boutiques including: Mustard, Isis, B and the Chai shop. For books head straight to Landmark and huge store has everything from books to perfumes and music. On the top floor of the mall you will find a PVR multiplex comprising 11 cinemas. For eating there is everything, Fast food (KFC, McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Subway) Cafe Coffee Day and a food court with world cuisines including: Chinese, Vietnamese, Mexican and Italian and Indian. Not to be missed is the Indian cuisine at Sahib Sindh Sultan and the British style pub, Firangi Pani. So that is a forum for all your shopping needs under one roof! Its just a must see, especially the outside.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Garuda Mall</b> - Located on the corner of McGrath and Commissariat Roads, is the newest and the second largest mall in Bengaluru. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Bengaluru Central</b> - Opened around the same as the Forum, Bengaluru Central is more of a large department store than a mall with separate retailers. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Safina Plaza</b> - The sale capital of Bengaluru, located on Infantry Road. Every week there is sale going on of any type. One week it might be home furnishings and the next men's wear. Good place to find some bargains. Many exhibitions are also held here, although there are retailers (Dockers, Lee Jeans, Titan too name a few) here too. So for quiet shopping come here (much less crowded than the other malls). Its best to visit during end of season sales (summer, monsoon) or during festivals (New Year, Christmas, Ganesh Chaturthi). 
</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Lifestyle</b> - A two-story store on Victoria Road in the heart of the new mall shopping district with malls like Garuda Mall, Bengaluru Central and Globus, all within easy walking distance and was one of the most coveted stores until the malls came along. It's an easy place to go shopping when you don't want too many options to confuse you or when you're tired and don't want to visit too many shops - you can get everything under one roof here. Good for clothes, cosmetics, watches, jewelry, shoes etc. You also get stylish furniture and other home and living items for a decent price.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Mantri Square</b> - It is located in Malleswaram and it is the largest mall in India.
</li></ul>
<p><b>Sampige Road, Malleswaram</b> - Sampige Road is the heart of Malleswaram and connects Sheshadripuram to IISc. Sampige Road is around 2 km, has a wide range of shops that sells books, electronic items, silk sarees, handicrafts, cloth materials, Hindu pooja materials, sweets and all the trivial things you can buy on earth. Also try Malleswaram 8th cross on Sampige road (aptly named Brigade Road of Malleswram) for a vibrant shopping experience. Sampige Road is also home to best flower market and fruits market in Bengaluru. If you are tired of going to individual shops you can go for the best departmental stores in Bengaluru like Fabmall, Foodworld and Nilgiris.
</p><p><b>Marathahalli Main Road and Factory Outlets</b>- Located a distance from central Bengaluru (although not difficult to reach), is Marathahalli (a village in a previous life). The main road of this suburb is now a haven for factory outlets for all major brands: Nike, Adidas, Pepe Jeans, Killer Jeans, Louis Phillipe, Levi's, Reebok etc. You can expect prices here to be cheaper than in the Malls, at least 20-30% price difference but can be up to 50% cheaper when it comes to some of the major denim brands! As if India wasn't cheap enough. Although this is the best place to go to for factory outlet shopping, there are smaller factory outlets scattered across the city. Also look out for sales held by the major brands to get rid of end of season stock (again end of summer or end of monsoon), these are usually advertised in newspapers or look for signs posted on major roads.
</p><p><b>Metro shopping mall</b>, (<i>near Yashwanthpura railway station and ISKON temple</i>).
</p><p><b>Jayanagar Shopping Complex</b>, From antique Jewellery (the famous Bhavani's, the more recent Kushal's, The Gallery), the authentic gold jewellery stores, saree stores (Kalamandir, Kalaniketan, Mysore Silk Udyog), sweet meat stores (Sri Krishna Sweets, Arya Bhavan), classic Iyengar bakeries, dress stores (Paridhan, Rangoli, Bafna's, Vinayaka Collections), through to fresh vegetables, fruits, meat and butter.
</p><p><b>Gandhi Bazaar</b>,  (<i>in the heart of Basavangudi</i>). One of the oldest shopping areas in Bangalore, Gandhi Bazaar stretches for a short kilometer or so, bordered on both sides by shops selling everything from saris and clothes to plastics and kitchen utensils, fronted by vegetable and fruit stalls. Do not forget to visit <i>Vidyarthi Bhavan</i> whenever you come here for this is the best South Indian restuarant in Bangalore selling the most heavenly dosas.
</p><p>Apart from the malls one should not forget to visit Commercial street, Brigade Road which are excellent shopping and hanging out places.
</p><p>The traditional markets have mom-and-pop stores that sell everything from fruits, vegetables, groceries to electronics, music, and mobile phones. The city's largest vegetable and fruit market is in the heart of the city and is called "KR Market" or "City Market". Smaller but more lively traditional markets can be found in residential areas such as Gandhi Bazaar, N R Colony, Banashankari, Malleswaram, Jayanagar, and JP Nagar &amp; Shivajinagar.
For people looking for Girls party wear dresses Magic Threads in Richmond town very close to the popular shopping area of Brigade road is a must visit.

</p><p>Bengaluru is far from the sea, and as such the quality of seafood can vary.  Some of the higher end and popular seafood places 
manage this well, but foreign travellers may want to tread a bit carefully.

Some of the must-try dishes are dum-root and butter-bun congress at VB Bakery. The dosas, <i>obbattu (sweet pancake)</i>, <i>akkirotti (rice pancake)</i>, fried <i>bondas</i>, butter-gulkand, and masala-pepsi available at the various stalls are also delicious. Note that the street comes alive only in the evenings (after 6PM) and that only vegetarian fare is available here.

</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Richies</b>, on MM Rd. (<i>Off Mosque Rd</i>). Serves the kind of biryani that is the Bengaluru original. It is located midway on MM Rd, and hard to miss because of the crowds that throng its takeaway counter. One visits Richies only for the food—tables and chairs made of synthetic wood, and dim light from gaudy chandeliers don’t exactly make for great ambiance. A motley bunch of diners cram the place for lunch and dinner (they have only recently built the 2nd and 3rd floors). The biryani here is delicious, and you must love meat to love Richies. The menu is limited; but the mutton and chicken biryani stand out and they are not flavoured with the same masala, or heaven forbid, rice, their kababs are something nice and unique too.
</li></ul>
<a name="Mid-range"></a><h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangalore&amp;action=edit&amp;section=47" title="Edit section: Mid-range">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mid-range</span></h3>

Turn right at the entrance for the more expensive (and decidedly less charming) A/C room. Rs 50-200.  Smoky, with sluggish service, and not particularly clean Koshy's still has plenty of character and history but its getting harder to justify their skyrocketing prices.  
</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Sue's Food Place</b>, Krishna Temple Rd, Indira Nagar. A Caribbean style restaurant run by Sue (Susan John from Trinidad and Tobago). It has an excellent buffet. Their Jamaican jerk chicken, salads and desserts are lovely. A la carte menu is available on certain days. Rs 200-500

</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>T.G.I Friday's</b>, Carlton Towers &amp; Airport Rd. Don't expect cheap Indian prices. Happy hours with 1+1 free on alcoholic beverages in the evening should make up for that.

<ul><li>There are few Dhabas catering to all tastes. Both South and North Indian fare is available at most places and is clean and cheap. A special mention is the green park dhaba on the outskirts on Bellary Road and Golconda Chimney on the old airport road in Marthahalli , opposite Shankara Eye Hospital. Golconda Chimmney has been recently renovated and has both A/c and non-A/C sections, the non-veg spread is simply amazing , but the rates are steep if you have a traditional dhaba in mind. The ambience is nice. Try the chicken kathi rolls and the biryani.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Bobby-da-Dhaba</b>, (<i>near Ulsoor Lake. Take a left turn from MG Road - Trinity Circle and ask for Gurudwara the Sikh temple</i>). Right next to the Gurudwara is Bobby-da-Dhaba. The food is quite good (albeit slightly oily). It basically serves paranthas (with lots of butter), chaach, kheer and a number of side dishes (most notable being their shahi paneer and rajma). You may have to wait for a while in case it is full. So it's better to go slightly early, 12PM for lunch and 7:30PM for dinner to avoid rush).

<ul><li><b>Others around Majestic</b>, If you are free for an hour, you can just go around the Majastic theatre and the Kempe Gowda Bus Station and look for a budget hotel yourself, as there are many on small streets and roads around this place.  Or, you can even trust (to some extent) a broker who voluntarily offers help, but be sure you take a good look at the rooms before you pay any money to the lodge and the broker.  But there is a wrong notion in the minds of people in and around Majestic that whenever you go in pairs, they tend to look at you with a wrong and suspicious look. If coming with family, especially newly married, avoid the Majestic area.

<p>Bengaluru is a relatively safe city during day time. However, unlike Mumbai which never sleeps, most of Bengaluru practically shuts down a little before midnight - even very safe residential areas can be very desolate by 11PM. 
</p><p>Some of the lower-income areas can be somewhat unsafe once it gets dark. Exercising caution and good sense will increase your chances of staying safe.
</p>
<ul><li> It is not advisable to walk alone along deserted alleyways or lanes after dark. Avoid doing so in areas that you are not sure are reasonably safe
</li><li> Avoid using an autorickshaw if the driver is not alone, especially at night
</li><li> Do not flaunt jewellery, high-end mobile phones / laptops, watches etc.
</li><li> Do not withdraw large amounts of cash from ATMs in deserted areas
</li><li> Beware of pickpockets in crowded areas such as exhibitions, cricket matches etc.
</li><li> If you are returning late from a party, it is advisable to pre-book cabs through reputed companies such as Meru as against flagging down an autorickshaw on the road
</li><li> Exercise caution in stopping to help if you see a broken down vehicle at night, especially in lonely streets and in cases where you will be outnumbered
</li></ul>
<p>Rising incomes has brought an influx of people including both, white and blue collar immigrants, leading to disparities in earnings between locals, the casual labour immigrants and expatriates (people from other parts of the state and also from other countries) which arguably has resulted in a substantial increase in crime rates.

<p>The area code for Bengaluru is 080. When calling from overseas, dial +91 80 XXXX XXXX. If you don’t have an Indian phone number, it is strongly recommended that you get a  pre-paid calling card if you plan on using your phone frequently. Because of new government regulations, you need a photocopy of your passport (visa and the ID pages), a color photo, and proof of local address (in Bengaluru) when buying a pre-paid card. If you do not have the required paperwork, it is recommended that you ask a local friend to buy a pre-paid card on your behalf. Pre-paid cards are sold in a few of the shops that sell mobile equipment. 
</p><p>Public telephones are a good option and are available widely. Most shops that offer public phones sport easily visible "STD/ISD/PCO" signages. More often than not, public pay-phones are post-pay and there will be a person at the shop to take the payments. Check the bill generated from the machine and make the payment accordingly. Payments are always in Indian rupees.

<p>Bengaluru is a clean city (compared to other major Indian cities such as Mumbai, Kolkata) and epidemics are rare. However, foreign tourists should be cautious about consuming water and eating at roadside stalls. It is recommended to use mosquito repellents, either as a cream applied on the skin or in the electronic form, during the evenings.

<p>You will not find money exchange kiosks / counters in all parts of Bangalore, because Bangalore is not a primary destination for most tourists nor is it the entry point for most tourists entering the region. However, most banks offer currency exchange in all their branch offices as do some travel agencies. Exchange rates can vary somewhat, so it is advisable to shop around. Typically, travel agencies will offer a better exchange rate as compared to the rates offered by banks.
